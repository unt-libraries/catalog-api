    """
    Exporter class. Subclass this to define your export jobs. Your
    class names should match exactly 1:1 with the ExportType.codes
    you've defined.
    
    Your Exporter subclasses should at the very LEAST override the
    export_records() method to define how the export works.

    If your exports are syncing Sierra with an external index or data
    store, such as Solr, then each time you load data you want to make
    sure you're also deleting records from the index that were deleted
    from Sierra (or--if you're excluding records from your external
    store based on other criteria, like record suppression, you want
    to make sure those get deleted correctly as well). In this case,
    you should override delete_records() to define how to do those
    deletions. You should also make sure you define the deletion_filter
    attribute, which provides the filter for deletions. By default, we
    get deletions from RecordMetadata--this is because, when a record
    is deleted from Sierra, all data gets removed except for the row in
    RecordMetadata. So your deletion_filter should assume you're
    filtering from the POV of the RecordMetadata model. Alternatively,
    you can simply override the get_deletions method and do whatever
    you want.
    
    The deletion_filter attribute should contain a list of
    dictionaries, where each dict contains keyword filter criteria that
    should be ANDed together and each dict group then gets ORed to
    produce the final filter.
    
    If your export job doesn't need to handle deletions, simply don't
    specify a deletion_filter in your subclass--the get_deletions
    method will return None and you won't have to worry about it.
    
    In certain cases you might want to apply some sort of base filter
    when getting records, aside from whatever export filter is used.
    For instance, if you want to filter out suppressed records. To do
    this, you can set the record_filter attribute. It uses the same
    format as deletion_filter. If you do this, make sure your deletion
    filter will select the correct records for deletion--e.g., if you
    filter out suppressed records from getting loaded into Solr, then
    you'll want to check for newly suppressed records in your deletion
    filter along with deleted records.
    
    Use select_related and prefetch_related attributes to specify what
    related objects should be prefetched or preselected when records
    are fetched from the DB. These have a MASSIVE performance benefit
    if your job uses a lot of data in related tables, so use them!
    (See the Django docs on the Queryset API for info about
    prefetch_related and select_related.)
    
    Note about max_rec_chunk and max_del_chunk. These are used by
    the tasks.py module that breaks up record loads and delegates tasks
    out to Celery. The max_rec_chunk size is the size of the chunk used
    for record loads and the max_del_chunk size is the size of chunk
    used for deletions. Depending on your export, how much
    you're loading into memory at once (e.g. with prefetch_related),
    and how many parallel chunks you're allowing, chunks greater than
    5000 could use up all your memory. Keep an eye on it when you're
    testing your export jobs, and adjust those numbers accordingly.
    Needs will also likely vary by environment; if developing via the
    Docker env, your dev containers may lack power and memory that you
    have in production. You can override these settings for ANY
    Exporter class via the settings file or the .env file. The values
    set in the class end up serving as the defaults, which you can
    override if you want to on an env-specific basis. See the base
    settings module's EXPORTER_MAX_*_CONFIG settings for more info.

class AttachedRecordExporter(CompoundMixin, Exporter):
    """
    Base class for creating exporters that export a main set of records
    plus one or more sets of attached records.

    The base Child config class for exporters of this type defines a
    base `derive_records_from_parent` method. In subclasses, this
    method should derive child records given a record from the main,
    parent exporter's record set. The default behavior just returns the
    parent_record.

    Example: BibsAndAttached is a Compound exporter that exports a set
    of bib records to Solr along with the items and holdings attached
    to each bib record in that set. The `derive_records...` method for
    the ItemChild type takes a bib record (model instance) and returns
    the list of attached items. The `derive_recordsets_from_parent`
    method on the AttachedRecordExporter object then compiles all the
    recordsets together.

    Because this implementation fetches attached records *during* the
    `export_records` run, and NOT during `get_records`, exporters of
    this type are extremely memory-intensive. The `prefetch_related`
    attribute is implemented as a property that calculates appropriate
    values from ALL children. Hence, the `rel_prefix` Child config
    attribute: this should be defined on attached children config
    classes, telling the exporter what prefix should be placed before
    each field in select_related and prefetch_related for that child,
    relative to the parent.

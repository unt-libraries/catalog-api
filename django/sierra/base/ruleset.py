"""
`ruleset` module for catalog-api `base` app.

This provides classes to help implement logic for local business rules
based on Sierra-specific codes and behavior not easily extracted from
the Sierra DB. For things like: Collections (based on scope rules,
which aren't held in the Sierra DB); request rules (also not held in
the Sierra DB); hierarchy for location codes; etc.

I've put implementations of these classes in `local_rulesets.py`; if
you are implementing this at your institution, you will want to
override that locally.

class Ruleset(object):
    """
    Map one or more of an object's attribute values to an output value.

    Initialize a Ruleset by providing a list of `rules` and an optional
    `default` value. Each rule is a 2-length tuple. The first item
    defines how to get the comparison value from the object. It can be
    a string (attr name or dict key), a tuple of strings, or a callable
    or function. If it's callable, it should take the object as the arg
    and return the comparison value. The second tuple item is an object
    that maps the values from the object to result values. The mapping
    object may or may not be a dict; it only must implement a dict-like
    `get` method to be used in a Ruleset.

    Trigger the Ruleset by calling the `evaluate` method, providing an
    object instance of the intended type (`obj`). It evaluates rules in
    order and does NOT stop when a matching rule is found. Later rules
    acting on the same values for the same attributes will override
    earlier ones. This allows you to place more general rules first and
    more specific rules (i.e. overrides) later.

    An example ruleset could look like this:

    >>> requestable_ruleset = Ruleset([
    >>>     ('location_id', {'czm': False, 'law': False, 'w': False}),
    >>>     ('itype_id', {7: False, 8: False, 22: False}),
    >>>     (('itype_id', 'location_id'), {(7, 'xmus'): True})
    >>> ], default=True)

    An object with `location_id` 'czm', 'law', or 'w' would return
    False. An object with `itype_id` 7 would return False unless it
    also had `location_id` 'xmus', in which case it would return True.
    Objects with `itype_id` 8 or 22 would return False. Everything else
    would return the default value of True.

def reverse_mapping(forward_mapping, multi=True):
    """
    Generate the reverse of the provided `forward_mapping`.
    This is a utility function for helping define mappings to use in
    Rulesets to make them more concise.

    Values in `forward_mapping` can be any iterable: sets, lists,
    tuples, etc. During the reversal they will be converted to dict key
    values (and will thus be made unique).

    Use `multi` to control whether or not you want values in the return
    dict to be sets (if True) or not (if False); if True, then a value
    from the original dict that appears in multiple entries will have
    all entries preserved.

    For example:

    >>> forward_mapping = {
    >>>     'Collection1': set(['code1', 'code2']),
    >>>     'Collection2': set(['code2', 'code3'])
    >>> }
    >>> reverse_mapping(forward_mapping, multi=True)

        'code1': set(['Collection1']),
        'code2': set(['Collection1', 'Collection2']),
        'code3': set(['Collection2']),
    }
    >>> reverse_mapping(forward_mapping, multi=False)
    {
        'code1': 'Collection1',
        'code2': 'Collection2',
        'code3': 'Collection2'
    }

    Be careful when using multi=False, if you have overlapping values
    (such as 'code2' in the above example). There's no way to gaurantee
    the order `forward_mapping` will be evaluated in, so it could get
    either value. You can use an OrderedDict to work around this.

class StrPatternMap(object):
    """
    Map strings (i.e., codes) to labels based on regex patterns.
    StrPatternMap objects use a similar `get` method interface used by
    dicts; however they default to returning 'None' rather than raising
    a KeyError for non-matching values.

    This is a utility class intended for use as an alternative-style
    mapping (rather than a dict) in Rulesets. Essentially, instead of
    mapping strings to strings, you're mapping string patterns to
    strings (or any other value).

    For example:

    >>> pmap = StrPatternMap({
    >>>     r'^w': 'Willis Library',
    >>>     r'^s': 'Eagle Commons Library'}, exclude=['wx'])

    Access info about a relationship between two Django Model objects.

    The relationship a given Relation object represents is from the POV
    of the model provided on init--e.g., model.fieldname. It's mainly a
    simplified way to get information about that relationship.

    After initializing a Relation object, you can access the POV model
    on self.model, the model at the other end of the relationship on
    self.target_model, the POV model name on self.model_name, the
    target model name on self.target_model_name, and the name of the
    attribute containing the relationship on self.fieldname, and that
    attribute itself on self.accessor.

    Public methods:

    `arrange_models` returns a list containing self.model and
    self.target_model arranged in order based on which is dependent on
    the other. A model with an FK relationship to the target model is
    assumed to be dependent on that model--data for the target model
    should be loaded into the database before the FKs exist to use to
    populate data for the dependent model. Optionally, a model list
    may be supplied to this method--if it is, then models are arranged
    in place in the list if they appear there, and the full list is
    returned. If they don't appear, they are added or inserted as
    needed to satisfy dependencies.

    `fetch_target_model_objects` returns a list of Django Model object
    instances related to a set of source object instances via this
    relation.

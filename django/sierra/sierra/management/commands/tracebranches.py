    Run a `tracebranches` command from manage.py.

    Use this as a utility to help you generate the `user_branches`
    parameter in your `makefixtures` config file. Running this outputs
    a JSON array specifying all the many-to-many and direct foreign-key
    relationship branches stemming from a particular model. You can
    then prune those branches by hand in your config file if you just
    want a subset of those branches.

    This command takes one argument that identifies the root model you
    wish to run through tracebranches (`app.model`).

    Example:

    python manage.py tracebranches myapp.Users
